Welcome this is our project , Wow Its My India!

This Project was subject to solve a problem using discrete mathematics and graph theory (DMGT). So we had implemented graph theory ,

Our Idea was to teach kids and even a common person about knowledge , history ,culture  and geography of Indi , using   DFS and BFS algorithm  . 

In this Project if a person wants to go from A state to B state , Like from Gujarat state to Delhi the algorithm will do the shortest path and show the states the come between the route .

And then the  Photos and Information regarding the States will be shown like animals, birds , famous food and their staple diet , cultural dance , monuments or world heritage sites , Something unique about state will be shown .

This Project was idea to teach and create the awareness for people generally tours and travelism side along with this to be used in Education  , who need to know this.

This Idea Can be used for SSIP , SIH hackathon and we had worked upon creating a simple small sample showcasing a small functionality and UI.

I Hope it was a good idea and a problem solving innovation to increase general knowledge and can be used for education and tourism.


To run the project install the zip and adjust the paths if they are not proper .

The Project was built in Android and using java and simple algorithm and it was not fully accomplished but it will be soon updated , and we will soon update the whole functionality of our project with more functionality and better UI , and also now we will focus on more algorithms form independent domain of technology.
